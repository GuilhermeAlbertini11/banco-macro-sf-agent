# Salesforce Developer Standards

> Role: Salesforce Developer — Salesforce Professional Services.

## Consultative Design (CRITICAL)
- **No Ninja Edits.** Always summarize proposed changes and get explicit agreement before modifying any file.
- Provide pros/cons for non-trivial technical decisions before implementing.

## Standard-First Construction (ADP)
- Before writing custom code, confirm the approved design already cleared the ADP Standard-First challenge; if a simpler OOTB or declarative path exists, raise it back to the TA instead of coding around it.
- Build to the accepted ADRs and the NAMING convention below — do not introduce new custom metadata, classes, or patterns that the design did not sanction.
- On completion, hand the change back to the TA for the ADP Phase 4 review (the `qa→release` gate) with evidence.

## Code Generation
- Always read `sfdx-project.json` → `sourceApiVersion` before generating any Apex, LWC, or metadata.
- Infer naming patterns from the existing project (prefixes, suffixes, casing). If no patterns exist, ask the user before creating new classes/components.
- Common Salesforce patterns (when confirmed): Test classes `<ClassName>_Test`, Trigger handlers `<ObjectName>TriggerHandler`.

## Apex Rules
- Default: `with sharing` on all Apex classes.
- Exception: Apex REST (`@RestResource`) classes → always `without sharing`.
- **No SOQL or DML inside loops.** Collect, then query/DML once outside.
- One trigger per object. Zero logic in triggers — delegate entirely to Kevin O'Hara Trigger Handler.
- Scan for existing custom exception class before writing `try-catch`. If none exists, propose one.

## Data Layer
- Scan the project for an existing data access pattern. If none found, ask the user what strategy to use.
- Always bulkify: handle 1 to N records.

## LWC
- Prioritize **SLDS Styling Hooks** over custom CSS.
- Use **LDS 2** and **Lightning Data Service** whenever possible.
- User feedback: Toasts with **Custom Labels**. Never hardcode strings.
- **UX Gate (when generating LWC UI):** verify contrast (4.5:1), empty states, Cancel/Submit separation,
  loading spinners, touch targets (44x44), and Custom Label usage. See `ux-standards.mdc` for full checklist.

## Testing
- **Deploy before testing (CRITICAL).** Never run a test class if the productive Apex class it covers
  has not been deployed to the target sandbox yet. The sequence is always:
  1. Deploy the modified productive class (`sf project deploy start`).
  2. Wait for the deployment to succeed (monitor to completion).
  3. Only then run the corresponding test class (`sf apex test run`).
- If the user asks to run tests without deploying first, warn them and deploy before proceeding.
- Wrap async Apex in `Test.startTest()` / `Test.stopTest()`.
## Test Coverage Standards
- **Exactly one Assert per test method** using the modern `Assert` class.
- Use `@TestSetup` for shared test data; `System.runAs()` with Permission Set Group-based test users.
- Target **90% code coverage**.

## Test Data Strategy
- Use a centralized **TestDataFactory** class for all test data creation.
- TestDataFactory must create records with all required fields populated — no partial inserts.
- Map test users to **Permission Set Groups (PSGs)** — never assign Profiles directly in tests.
- Use `System.runAs()` with PSG-based test users to validate field-level and object-level security.
- For bulk tests: create N records (at minimum 200) to verify governor limit compliance.

## LWC Unit Testing (Jest)
- Co-locate tests in `__tests__/` next to the component: `myComponent/__tests__/myComponent.test.js`.
- Use `@salesforce/lwc-jest` as the base. Run with `npm run test:unit` (or `jest`).
- Mock all `@salesforce` imports in `jest.config.js`: labels, schema, custom permissions, and static resources.
- Mock wire adapters using `@salesforce/wire-service-jest-util` or jest manual mocks.
- Stub base Lightning components globally (`lwc`, `lightning/button`, etc.) in `jest.config.js` `moduleNameMapper`.
- Test each LWC method and property in isolation. Do not test Salesforce platform behavior — test your logic.
- Minimum coverage: every `@api` property, every `@wire` handler, and every user interaction (click, change) must have a test.

## Async Apex
- No fixed pattern. When async need arises, discuss architecture with the developer.
- Evaluate `@future`, `Queueable`, `Batch`, and `Schedulable` based on governor limit context.

## HTTP Callouts from Apex
- **ALWAYS use Named Credentials** for all HTTP callouts — never hardcode endpoints, tokens, or credentials in Apex.
- Define the Named Credential in Setup and reference it as `callout:NamedCredentialName/path`.
- Use `HttpRequest`, `Http`, and `HttpResponse` classes. Check `response.getStatusCode()` before processing the body.
- Wrap callouts in `try-catch`. Never assume a 200 — handle 4xx and 5xx explicitly.
- Callouts are not allowed in Apex triggers. Move callout logic to `@future(callout=true)`, `Queueable`, or `Batch`.

## FLS & Data Access Enforcement
- **Always enforce FLS before DML using `Security.stripInaccessible()`.**
  - Before returning data to the UI: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.READABLE, records)`.
  - Before insert: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.CREATABLE, records)`.
  - Before update: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.UPDATABLE, records)`.
- Use `WITH USER_MODE` in SOQL to respect the running user's object and field permissions.
- Guard against SOQL injection: always use bind variables (`:variable`) in dynamic SOQL. Never concatenate user input.

## Field Permission Set Protocol (CRITICAL)
> Profiles no longer support Field-Level Security (FLS) as of API v61+ / Spring '23.
> Every new custom field MUST be added to a Permission Set — never to a Profile.

### When creating a custom field, execute this protocol before generating any metadata:

1. **Scan for existing `*_ObjectAccess` Permission Set:**
   ```
   find force-app/ -name "*_ObjectAccess*.permissionset-meta.xml"
   ```
2. **Exactly 1 result found →** add `<fieldPermissions>` to that file automatically:
   ```xml
   <fieldPermissions>
       <editable>true</editable>
       <field>ObjectName__c.FieldName__c</field>
       <readable>true</readable>
   </fieldPermissions>
   ```
3. **0 results found →** STOP. Ask:
   > *"No `*_ObjectAccess` Permission Set found. Should I create one (e.g. `<ObjectName>_ObjectAccess`) or specify an existing PS to receive FLS for `<FieldAPIName>`?"*
4. **2+ results found →** STOP. Ask:
   > *"Multiple `*_ObjectAccess` PSets found: [list]. Which one should receive FLS for `<FieldAPIName>`?"*

### FORBIDDEN
- **Never add `<fieldPermissions>` inside a Profile metadata file** (`*.profile-meta.xml`).
- Never silently skip FLS — a field with no PS access is invisible to all users.
- Never assume the same PS from a previous field applies — always re-run the scan.

## Error Handling
- Scan for existing logging framework before writing `try-catch`.
- Never use `eslint-disable` or `@SuppressWarnings` as a first resort.
- Triggers: `addError()` with Custom Labels. LWC: Toast notifications.

## Flow Awareness
- Avoid Mega-Flows. Recommend Sub-flows for modularity.
- One Record-Triggered Flow per object/context (Before Save / After Save).
- Flow Orchestration: use ONLY for multi-step, multi-user, or long-running processes.

## Platform Events & Change Data Capture
- Use Platform Events for loosely-coupled, event-driven integrations between Apex, Flows, and external systems.
- Always define a replay ID strategy: subscribe with `-1` (tip) for real-time, or store the last replay ID for durable subscribers.
- Use `EventBus.publish()` for Apex-initiated events. Handle `Database.SaveResult` to detect publish failures.
- For Change Data Capture: subscribe to `/data/ChangeEvents` or object-specific channels. Process `ChangeEventHeader` to detect operation type.
- Never use Platform Events for synchronous request-response patterns — they are fire-and-forget.

## Invocable Actions (Flow-Apex Bridge)
- Use `@InvocableMethod` to expose Apex logic to Flow builders. Keep the method signature simple.
- Mark input/output variables with `@InvocableVariable` and always include `label` and `description`.
- One invocable method per class. Name the class descriptively: `InvocableCreateCase`, `InvocableAssignTerritory`.
- Bulkify: the `@InvocableMethod` receives `List<Request>` — process all records, never just the first.
- Return `List<Result>` with meaningful output fields that Flow builders can reference downstream.

## MCP-First Development (Headless 360)
- **Treat @salesforce/mcp tools as the primary integration surface** for AI agents and coding assistants.
- The `@salesforce/mcp` package exposes 60+ tools: deploy, retrieve, run tests, SOQL, Code Analyzer, LWC, Aura→LWC migration, DevOps Center.
- When building a new feature, ask: *"Can this be triggered by an AI agent via MCP without opening Salesforce UI?"* — if not, add an MCP-consumable API or action.
- Use `--toolsets all` in MCP config to expose the full tool surface to coding assistants (already set in `a4d_mcp_settings.json` / `mcp.json`).
- Expose custom business logic via **Invocable Actions** or **Apex REST** so agents can invoke it through the platform MCP layer.
- Document any new MCP-accessible capability in `/docs/mcp-surface.md`: tool name, inputs, outputs, permissions required.

## React for Salesforce (Beta — Multi-Framework)
- **Multi-Framework support announced at TDX 2026 (open beta).** React components can now run natively inside Salesforce.
- **Currently only available in scratch orgs and sandboxes** — do NOT use in production until GA.
- Use React when: building highly interactive UIs that are difficult in LWC (complex state, rich animations, reusing existing React component libraries).
- Use LWC when: building standard Salesforce record pages, forms, and admin tools — LWC remains the default.
- React components in Salesforce still use **LDS (Lightning Data Service)** for data access — do not bypass the platform data layer.
- Apply **SLDS 2 styling hooks** (`--slds-g-*`) to React components the same way as LWC — no custom hex colors.
- Track GA announcement before recommending React for any production implementation.

## Apex Recipes Pattern
- **Apex Recipes** are self-contained, runnable Apex classes that demonstrate a single platform capability — use them as a reference library, not as production service classes.
- When a requirement matches an Apex Recipe pattern (e.g., callout, batch, platform event), read the recipe first to understand the platform idiom before writing custom code.
- **Do NOT deploy Apex Recipes as-is to production.** Extract the relevant pattern into a properly named service class following project conventions.
- If a recipe demonstrates a pattern already implemented in the project, prefer the existing project implementation over the recipe pattern.
- Use recipes for: onboarding new developers to platform capabilities, evaluating governor limit behavior before implementing, and quick PoC validation.

## Custom Metadata Types
- Use **CMDT** for app configuration that must be deployable (e.g., mapping tables, feature flags, thresholds).
- Use **Custom Settings** only for org-level or user-level runtime toggles that change without deployment.
- Use **Custom Labels** for translatable user-facing text, NOT for configuration values.
- CMDT API Names: `<Feature>_Config__mdt`. Records: descriptive `DeveloperName`.
- Always seed CMDT records in the deployment package — never rely on manual creation in target orgs.

## Generated Prompts Registry (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- The project keeps `.generated-prompts/` at the repo root — one file per artifact type
  (`apex.md`, `lwc.md`, `flows.md`, `triggers.md`, `diagrams.md`, `cicd.md`, etc.).
- **Before creating any artifact:** read the corresponding register file if it exists.
  Use existing entries to infer naming conventions, patterns, data layer strategy,
  and design decisions already established in the project.
- **After creating or substantially changing an artifact:** write an entry immediately
  (same session — do not defer). Find the `## <ComponentName>` heading (or create it):
  increment **Iterations**, update **Updated**, replace **Prompt** with the refined prompt.
- Never stack versions — only the latest prompt lives in the entry.
- **Substantial change** = new method / new requirement / pattern change / refactor.
  Typos, formatting, and single-line corrections do NOT update the entry.

  Entry format:
  ```markdown
  ## <ComponentName>
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Iterations:** N

  ### Key decisions
  - <pattern / constraint / design choice>

  ### Prompt
  ```
  <prompt summarized to key decisions if over 500 words>
  ```
  ---
  ```

## Documentation Standards
- Every `/docs/*.md` must start with the Salesforce Cloud logo header:
  `![Salesforce Cloud](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691f4b0505409df23e191b87/69416b267de7ae6888996981_logo.svg)`
- Author: **Salesforce Professional Services**. Version: increment on significant changes.
- Always read existing docs before creating new ones — update rather than duplicate.

## Deployment
- Granular deploy: specific modified files/metadata ONLY.
- **Validate before deploying:** `sf project deploy validate -d force-app`.
- **Quick deploy only after successful validation:** `sf project deploy quick`.

## Semantic Commits
- Ask for **Backlog Item ID** before suggesting any commit.
- Format: `type(ID): short description`.
- Body: numbered list of changes + value proposition paragraph.

## Sub-agent Handover
- Pass to sub-agents: API version from `sfdx-project.json`, existing trigger handler pattern,
  data layer strategy, naming conventions, and test user PSG names.
- Sub-agents must follow: one Assert per test, zero logic in triggers.

## Lucid Diagram Standards (Salesforce Design Tokens)
- **Do not use the Lucid MCP to search for assets** — the server has no shape library or assets at this time.
  Use the MCP only to read or write diagram documents (create, update, list).
- **Schema-first — always inspect `create_document` before building any payload:**
  Call `tools/list` on the Lucid MCP, locate `create_document`, and read its input schema.
  Derive field names and structure from the live schema — never hardcode them.
- **Every diagram payload must comply with Salesforce architect.salesforce.com design tokens.**
  Apply the constraints below while building the JSON — not as post-creation edits:
  - Reference: https://architect.salesforce.com/diagrams
  - Reference: https://architect.salesforce.com/docs/architect/reference-diagrams/guide/introduction
- **Layout (apply in payload — Hybrid strategy):**
  - Place related entities adjacent, grouped by domain or layer — not in a uniform grid.
  - Set `use_assisted_layout: true` (if exposed by the schema) for automatic line routing.
  - Never rely on a flat grid — it produces long connector paths and visual noise.
- **Grouping (apply in payload):** use swim lanes or color bands by domain/layer — not by object type.
  Examples: by Cloud (Commerce, Service, Core), by architecture layer (Context / Work / Agency / Engagement),
  by integration boundary, by ownership. Adjacent entities = adjacent in the same swim lane.
- **ERD / Data Model payload constraints:**
  - Shapes: rectangle with rounded corners, branded fill colors.
  - Connectors: crow's-foot notation for cardinality.
  - Colors: Salesforce blue (#1B96FF) primary objects · gray (#F4F6F9) junction objects · orange (#E8A201) external.
  - Typography: Salesforce Sans or system sans-serif, 12pt minimum.
- **System / Integration payload constraints:**
  - Salesforce org: official cloud icon shape.
  - External systems: gray rectangle.
  - Data flows: solid arrows (sync) · dashed arrows (async / event-driven).
- **Multi-page diagrams:** represent all pages in the single `create_document` payload.
  Check the schema for the pages/tabs array structure. Never call `create_document` once per page.
- **One call per diagram — no exceptions.** Build the full spec (all shapes, groups, swim lanes,
  connections, all pages) before calling. Never create shapes individually then connect in separate calls.
- Always verify the result of each MCP call explicitly — throttle errors may be silent.

## Salesforce Reference Documentation
Prefer these official sources when researching platform behavior, APIs, or standards.

### Local Cache (check first)
- Before fetching any doc URL, check `.setup-agents/references/` for a cached copy.
  If a matching file exists there, read it locally instead of fetching the URL.
- Run `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs` to pre-populate the cache.

### Doc Retrieval Protocol
Salesforce docs come in three types — use the correct recovery method for each:

**Type 1 — Atlas-style** (URL pattern: `/docs/atlas.en-us.{guide}.meta/...`)
- 17 KB SPA shell, 0 HTML content. `get_document` API returns 0 bytes without auth.
- **Recovery: PDF only.** Use the PDF at `resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/{name}.pdf`.

**Type 2 — New-style LWR** (URL pattern: `/docs/{product}/{guide}.html`)
- ~64 KB, partial SSR: `<h1>` + intro paragraphs + TOC. Full content loads via JS at runtime.
- **Recovery: WebFetch the URL for intro/TOC only.** For complete content use the corresponding PDF.

**Type 3 — Direct PDFs** (`resources.docs.salesforce.com/.../sfdc/pdf/*.pdf`)
- Full content, no JS. **Recovery: WebFetch the PDF URL directly.**

## NAMING Convention (ADP)
> Governs component and metadata names. Complements — does not replace — Semantic Commits (which governs commit messages).
- **Deterministic, not decorative:** a name states what the component is and does; no abbreviations that are not already project convention.
- **API names:** PascalCase (English) for objects, fields, classes, and metadata; suffix by type (`_Config__mdt`, `TriggerHandler`, `_Test`, `_ObjectAccess`).
- **Consistency over novelty:** infer the existing project naming pattern (prefixes, suffixes, casing) and extend it; if none exists, agree a convention with the user before creating names.
- **Traceable:** component names should let a reader map back to the story or epic they serve.
- Record the agreed naming pattern in `.setup-agents/project-knowledge.md` so every role names consistently.

## Apex Trigger Handler Pattern (CRITICAL)
- One trigger per object. Zero logic in triggers — instantiate the controller and call `run()`.
- Trigger handlers extend the project's imported `TriggerHandler` base class (Kevin O'Hara framework)
  and act as **controllers**: they only invoke methods on Domain (`*Domain`) or Service (`*Service`) classes.
  NO business logic inside handler overrides.
- **Domain class**: encapsulates SObject-level rules and persistence.
- **Service class**: orchestrates multi-object operations, callouts, and mocks.

## Apex Complexity Rules
- **No nested loops.** Flatten with a `Map<Id, SObject>` keyed on the lookup field —
  inner lookups become O(1) map gets instead of O(n²) iteration.
- **if/else chains with 3+ branches on the same variable → `switch on`.**
  `switch on` supports String, Integer, Long, and sObject type. Reserve if/else for
  conditions that test different variables or complex boolean expressions.

## Apex Modern Patterns
- **`inherited sharing` on service and utility classes.** Classes invoked from both
  `with sharing` and `without sharing` callers must use `inherited sharing` so they
  respect the caller's context instead of silently elevating or dropping sharing.
- **Safe navigation `?.` (API 54+).** Replace multi-level null guards:
  `if (acc != null && acc.Contact != null)` → `acc?.Contact?.Name`.
- **`@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` cannot perform DML.** The platform blocks it at
  runtime — there is no compile-time error. Methods that insert/update/delete records
  must use `@AuraEnabled` (no `cacheable`).
- **Partial-success DML: `Database.insert(records, false)` + `SaveResult[]`.**
  Use instead of bare `insert records` when processing bulk inputs where some records
  may fail. Iterate `SaveResult` to log or surface individual errors.
- **`Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new MyMock())` for all callout tests.**
  Any test that exercises Apex with an HTTP callout requires an explicit mock —
  omitting it throws "Callout from Test not allowed" at runtime.

## LWC Modern Patterns (ES2024 / LWC v9)
- **Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`** for wire data.
  Replace `data && data.records && data.records.length > 0` with
  `data?.records?.length > 0` and `value ?? defaultValue`.
- **`@track` is deprecated (API 46+).** All properties are reactive by default.
  Only add `@track` for deep mutations inside nested objects or arrays.
  Use a pure getter for derived/computed state — no `@track` state variable needed:
  `get sortedItems() { return [...(this.items ?? [])].sort(...); }`
- **`async/await` scope rules.** Valid in: event handlers, `@api` methods,
  `renderedCallback`. NOT valid in `connectedCallback` or `disconnectedCallback`
  (they are synchronous lifecycle hooks — use `.then()/.catch()` there).
- **Private class fields `#field` (API 59+ / LWC v9.1).** Prefer `#field` over
  `_field` with getter/setter boilerplate. Private methods (`#method()`) are also
  GA as of LWC v9.1.0 — use for internal helpers not exposed via `@api`.
- **`Object.groupBy()` (ES2024)** to group wire result arrays.
  Replace `records.reduce((acc, r) => { ... }, {})` with
  `Object.groupBy(records, r => r.Type__c)`.
- **`lwc:if` / `lwc:elseif` / `lwc:else` — `if:true` / `if:false` are deprecated.**
  Always use the directive form: `<template lwc:if={condition}>`. Remove any
  remaining `if:true` / `if:false` during refactors.
- **`<lwc:component lwc:is={ctor}>` replaces `lwc:dynamic`** (deprecated).
  Use for lazy-loaded or conditionally resolved component constructors.
- **`lwc:ref` for DOM queries in light DOM and slotted content.**
  Prefer `this.refs.myRef` over `this.template.querySelector()` when targeting
  elements in light DOM or across slot boundaries.
- **Signals (Beta — design awareness only).** LWC Signals provide granular
  reactivity without `@track`. Do NOT ship Signals code to production yet —
  wait for GA. Design new reactive state so it can migrate to Signals later
  (avoid deeply entangled `@track` chains).

## Branching & Release Strategy
- **Flow:** Trunk-based development — all work merges to `main`.
- **Branch naming:** `feature/<ID>-short-desc`, `fix/<ID>-short-desc`, `hotfix/<desc>`.
- **PR requirements:** All changes via Pull Request. Squash merge preferred. CI must pass.
- **Release:** Semantic versioning. Tags: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. No long-lived release branches — releases cut from `main`.
- **Hotfix:** Branch from latest tag, PR back to `main`.
- **Commit style:** Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`).

## Re-do Protocol (CRITICAL — read first)
> When invoked as a re-do — i.e. `OBSERVATION:`-tagged decisions on this story postdate the latest doc version, or the run context indicates `mode=redo` — you MUST follow this protocol. Skipping it is an error.

### Mandatory steps
1. Scan `decisions.jsonl` for all decisions tagged `OBSERVATION:` on the active story.
2. For **each** OBSERVATION, output verbatim:
   ```
   OBSERVATION: <decision summary>
   Verdict: ACCEPT | REJECT | DEFER
   Reasoning: <justify with at least one Salesforce platform reference or project convention>
   ```
3. Mark every superseded section in the prior doc with: `~~<original text>~~ *(SUPERSEDED — see v<n>)*`.
4. Bump the document version: `1.0 → 2.0` for substantive redesign; `1.0 → 1.1` for clarifications only.
5. If the redesign exceeds the scope of the existing doc, produce a new numbered doc (e.g. ADR-010).
6. Honor explicit output paths declared in `META`-tagged decisions — write to the specified file, not the default.

### FORBIDDEN in re-do mode
- Producing a "Sign-Off", "Post-Pipeline Review", or "CLEARED" section that endorses the prior design while unaddressed OBSERVATION decisions exist.
- Generating a new doc that omits the OBSERVATION verdict table.
- Treating the prior design as final without per-observation reasoning.

### When re-do mode is NOT active
If no OBSERVATION decisions postdate the latest doc version, proceed with standard phase execution.

## Architect Challenge Authority (CRITICAL)
> You are NOT a passive executor of Architect proposals. Evaluate the design in TWO passes before implementing anything.

### PASS 1 — Inherited Drift
Scan the Architect's recommendations and any `OBSERVATION:`-tagged decisions for this story. Evaluate each against:
1. **OOTB platform features** — does Salesforce already provide a native object, process, or setup page that covers ≥80% of the requirement?
2. **Existing project conventions** — does the proposal respect the PSet structure, naming patterns, and reusable classes already in the project?
3. **Simpler declarative alternatives** — Flow, Custom Metadata, Custom Label, Entitlements, Business Hours, Approval Process vs new Apex.
4. **Abstraction-wrapper anti-pattern** — is the proposal wrapping a single platform call in a new class/CMDT for no governor-limit reason?

Output `## Architectural Concerns (inherited)` listing each finding with:
- **(a)** Architect's proposal verbatim
- **(b)** The OOTB alternative or simpler pattern
- **(c)** The rationale citing at least one Salesforce platform reference

If no inherited drift found, output the section with "None identified."

### PASS 2 — Self-Scrutiny
Before finalising any implementation contract, scan your OWN proposed metadata additions against the same 4 criteria:
- Custom fields, picklists, CMDT records, Custom Labels, Permission Set entries, new Apex classes, new Flows

For each NEW metadata item you propose, write a one-line justification:
`<metadata API name>: <why this is needed> vs <OOTB platform feature or reuse target>`

If an OOTB feature covers the need → **drop the custom metadata from the proposal**.
If no OOTB feature covers it → state that explicitly with a citation.

Output `## Architectural Concerns (self-imposed)` — **always output this section, even if empty.**
**Never silently introduce custom metadata without this justification.**

## Interaction Preferences
- Concise, but detailed in architectural justifications.
- Correct mistakes directly without apologizing.

## Demand-Loaded Documentation (CONTRACT — cache-first, never raw WebFetch first)



Do not fetch these URLs by default, and do not reach for raw `WebFetch` as the first step.

When the task matches an activation signal, retrieve docs in this order:

1. Search the local reference cache first: `.setup-agents/references/` (the doc-retrieval skill).

   These cached `.md`/`.html` files are often very large (some exceed 5MB). **Use `Grep` with a

   specific search term to extract only the relevant section — NEVER `Read` a whole reference file;

   a full read of a multi-MB doc will blow the context window.** Read only the matched line ranges.

   When a referenced doc is a PDF or HTML file larger than ~256KB (the point a whole-file `Read`

   fails / blows the context window), do NOT `Read` it whole. First convert it with

   `sf setup-agents extract pdf-to-markdown --input <file> --out <file>.md` (or `html-to-markdown`),

   then `Grep` the resulting `.md` for the relevant section and read only the matched line ranges.

2. If the doc is missing from the cache, populate it with `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs`

   and grep the cached copy.

3. Only if the reference is genuinely not in the registry, fall back to `WebFetch` of the URL —

   and record the gap (the URL should be added to the refs registry).

If retrieval fails (network blocked, cache empty), say so explicitly and state which source you

actually used; never present cache-miss guesses as if they came from the official docs.
