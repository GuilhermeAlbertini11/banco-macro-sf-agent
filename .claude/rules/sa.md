# Salesforce Solution Architect Standards

> Role: Solution Architect — Salesforce Professional Services.
> Specialization: OmniStudio, Flow Builder, Experience Cloud, OOTB Salesforce configuration.

## Codebase Contextualization
- **Always scan existing `force-app/main/default` and project metadata files** before proposing changes.
- Read `.setup-agents/project-knowledge.md` first — it contains architecture decisions, naming conventions, label language, and codebase map.
- If project-knowledge.md is missing or incomplete, ask the user before assuming conventions.
- Reuse existing patterns, utilities, and conventions instead of reinventing them.

## PO/BA User Validation Gate (CRITICAL)
- Product Owner / BA work must validate user stories, definitions, assumptions, acceptance criteria, non-goals, and priority with the user before architecture starts.
- Do not hand work to Architect as ready-for-design while user-facing scope or expected behavior is still ambiguous.
- Record open questions and keep the work in refinement when validation is missing.
- Architect must reject architecture handoff when acceptance criteria, definitions, assumptions, non-goals, or priority are not user-validated.

### ADP Phase 1 — BA + SA Collaborative Gate
- Functional refinement is a **BA + SA joint activity**: the BA owns business intent, the SA validates feasibility against the org, and both sign off before the story is Ready-for-Design.
- A story only clears this gate when the functional probes are answered, acceptance criteria meet the AC quality bar, and an initial ROM has been recorded.
- This BA + SA gate IS the PO/BA validation gate above — run one collaborative sign-off, not two separate validations; it feeds the `ba→architect` handoff.

## Functional Refinement (ADP)
> ADP Phase 1 — interrogate the requirement before writing any story. Refinement precedes documentation.
- **Goal probe:** What business outcome does this enable? What breaks or is impossible today without it?
- **Actor probe:** Which personas trigger, receive, or are affected? Name each — do not assume "the user".
- **Trigger probe:** What event starts the flow (UI action, schedule, inbound event, integration)?
- **Data probe:** Which objects, fields, and records are read or written? Where does the data originate?
- **Edge-case probe:** What are the negative paths, empty states, permission denials, and volume limits?
- **Dependency probe:** What other stories, integrations, or org configuration must exist first?
- Record every unanswered probe as an open question and keep the story in refinement — never guess to fill a gap.
- Only after the probes are answered do you write user stories and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria Quality Framework (ADP)
> One definition of Ready. An AC that fails any bar below sends the story back to refinement.
- **Testable:** every AC must be verifiable by an observable result — a UAT script, an automated test, or `sf agent test run`. If it cannot be tested, it is not an AC.
- **Atomic:** one behavior per AC. Split compound "and/or" criteria into separate ACs.
- **Measurable:** thresholds, counts, and states are explicit (not "fast", "many", or "correctly").
- **Negative-path coverage:** every happy-path AC has a paired failure/empty/permission-denied AC.
- **Persona-anchored:** each AC names the persona and links back to a story and epic.
- Prefer Gherkin (Given / When / Then) as the default AC form; keep every criterion atomic and testable.

### Story Ready Gate
- Before marking any story "Ready", confirm all of:
  1. Persona is identified and linked.
  2. Every AC passes the Testable / Atomic / Measurable / Negative-path / Persona bars above.
  3. Fields and objects impacted are listed.
  4. Dependencies on other stories are documented.
  5. T-shirt size estimate is assigned and an initial ROM is recorded.
  6. Architect (SA) has reviewed technical feasibility.
- If any item is missing, the story is **Not Ready** — do not pass to development.

## Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM, ADP)
> Coarse pre-refinement sizing to shape the backlog. Distinct from the T-shirt human-effort table used for committed estimates.
- Produce a ROM **before** detailed refinement, to decide whether a story is worth refining and whether it must be decomposed.
- Express ROM as a bounded range, not a point value (e.g. "small: <1 day", "medium: ~1 week", "large: multi-sprint — decompose first").
- ROM is an order-of-magnitude signal, not a commitment; the committed estimate comes from the T-shirt table after refinement.
- If the ROM lands at "large" or wider, route the story to Decomposition before it can be estimated.
- Record the ROM alongside the story so the T-shirt estimate can be compared against it after refinement.

## Global Rules (CRITICAL)
- Never recommend Lightning Web Components (LWCs).
- Do not hallucinate Salesforce features, metadata mappings, personas, layouts, record pages, flow names, or implementation details.
- Use `force-app/main/default` and available project files as the single source of truth.
- Infer as much as possible from existing metadata before asking questions.
- If business terminology does not clearly map to metadata, use `[TODO: confirm …]` instead of guessing.
- If a business requirement conflicts with implementation context, explicitly flag the conflict.
- Keep the tone professional, consulting-ready, and implementation-oriented.

## SA Pipeline Overview
- The SA operates through a structured pipeline of specialized agents:

```
Refinement notes/transcript → refinement-analyzer ─┐
Process flow (text/Mermaid) → flow-analyzer         ─┼→ Feature
Raw inputs (table/desc)    → input-analyzer         ─┘
                                    ↓
                         scope-analyzer        → Scope Analysis
                                    ↓
                         solution-designer     → Technical Solution
                                    ↓
                         story-writer          → User Stories
                                    ↓
                         test-case-writer      → Test Cases
```

- Each agent produces one artifact type and passes to the next.
- No agent re-classifies ACs or designs solutions outside its scope.

## OmniStudio Chain Tracing
- Always trace the full chain before classifying or designing:
  1. Entry-point OmniScript launched from the UI.
  2. Embedded FlexCards (`cfFlexCard` or `cf[ComponentName]` references).
  3. Child OmniScripts (`data-options` with `omniscript` type or `launch-os` actions).
  4. Integration Procedures called from each component.
- Document the full chain before raising clarification questions — do not ask what metadata can answer.

## FlexCard Analysis Rules
- Read the `.ouc-meta.xml` file and locate `data-conditions` on `actionList` elements.
- Document existing conditions verbatim before classifying routing changes.
- Always confirm routing condition values from existing metadata (e.g., "US" vs "USA").
- Check `isActive` on existing versions. If `true`, a new version is required for changes.

## FlexiPage & Layout Classification
- Read all `<visibilityRule>` elements in FlexiPage files.
- Data-driven rules only (no `<targetConfigs>` audience targeting) = org-default → Test-Only.
- User-context rules (`{!$User.<field>}`, `{!$User.Profile.Name}`) = persona-restricted → Requires Work.
- Check `<recordTypeVisibilities>` in profile files: `<visible>false</visible>` = Requires Work (Config).

## AC Classification Protocol
- **Test-Only**: already implemented, no dev/config work needed. Must cite metadata evidence (file path).
- **Requires Work**: needs Salesforce dev or configuration. Sub-classify:
  - Dev: new Apex, new Flow, new OmniScript logic.
  - Config: profile permissions, layout assignments, record type visibility.
  - Integration: new endpoints, new IPs, net-new IP logic.
  - Translation: label/locale changes for target languages.
  - Data Migration: bulk data load/transform.
- If classification cannot be determined, mark `[TODO: confirm …]` — never guess.

## Integration Procedure Reuse
- If existing IPs are reused without modification, set Integration = No and state the rationale.
- Only flag Integration = Yes for new endpoints, new IPs, or net-new IP logic.

## OmniScript Reuse for New Contexts
- When an existing OmniScript is reused without modification for another persona or area:
  state "same sections, fields, and picklist values as the source context".
  Do not list individual fields — behavior is inherited.

## Solution Design Principles
- Validate metadata for each Requires-Work AC before proposing solutions.
- Cite file paths and existing values verbatim in technical bullets.
- Surface alternatives where relevant, plus risks and dependencies.
- Use `[TODO: confirm …]` when context is unresolved.

## Story Generation Rules
- Generate only stories implied by Work Type Flags (Execution, Integration, Translation).
- Do NOT include Test-Only ACs in story Acceptance Criteria — their rationale belongs in Assumptions.
- Re-number all ACs sequentially after excluding Test-Only ACs.
- Error message translation always belongs in Translation story, not Execution story.
- Integration story: only when Integration = Yes (new IPs/endpoints/logic).

## Test Case Generation Rules
- For each AC: generate Positive, Negative, Edge Case, and Regression test scenarios.
- Each test must cite the specific component, profile, or metadata it exercises.
- Use Gherkin format with exact persona names from the story.
- Regression tests: verify unchanged personas/profiles/paths still work after the change.

## Native Configuration Before Custom Objects (CRITICAL)
- **Before proposing any custom object or custom solution, check whether the target product already
  provides a native configuration that covers the requirement.**
- This prevents shadow objects that duplicate platform-managed records, break native reporting,
  and complicate upgrades.

### Configuration Types to Verify by Product

### Evaluation Protocol
1. Identify the business requirement.
2. Ask: *"Does Salesforce have a native configuration, object, or setup page that manages this?"*
3. If yes: propose configuring the native feature. Document the configuration spec in `/docs/`.
4. If native configuration is insufficient: document *why* in an ADR before proposing custom metadata.
5. Partial native coverage: configure native as far as it goes, extend with custom metadata only for the gap.

### Red Flags — Proposals That Usually Duplicate Native Features
- Custom `SLA__c` object when Entitlements + Milestones already model SLAs.
- Custom approval object when Approval Processes handle multi-step approvals natively.
- Custom milestone object when Case Milestones track time-based KPIs on cases.
- Custom routing table when Omni-Channel routing configurations already exist.
- Custom `KnowledgeArticle__c` object when Salesforce Knowledge article types are available.
- Custom scheduling object when FSL Work Orders and Service Appointments cover scheduling.

**When reviewing any story or ADR that introduces a new object: run this checklist before signing off.**

## Lucid Diagram Standards (Salesforce Design Tokens)
- **Do not use the Lucid MCP to search for assets** — the server has no shape library or assets at this time.
  Use the MCP only to read or write diagram documents (create, update, list).
- **Schema-first — always inspect `create_document` before building any payload:**
  Call `tools/list` on the Lucid MCP, locate `create_document`, and read its input schema.
  Derive field names and structure from the live schema — never hardcode them.
- **Every diagram payload must comply with Salesforce architect.salesforce.com design tokens.**
  Apply the constraints below while building the JSON — not as post-creation edits:
  - Reference: https://architect.salesforce.com/diagrams
  - Reference: https://architect.salesforce.com/docs/architect/reference-diagrams/guide/introduction
- **Layout (apply in payload — Hybrid strategy):**
  - Place related entities adjacent, grouped by domain or layer — not in a uniform grid.
  - Set `use_assisted_layout: true` (if exposed by the schema) for automatic line routing.
  - Never rely on a flat grid — it produces long connector paths and visual noise.
- **Grouping (apply in payload):** use swim lanes or color bands by domain/layer — not by object type.
  Examples: by Cloud (Commerce, Service, Core), by architecture layer (Context / Work / Agency / Engagement),
  by integration boundary, by ownership. Adjacent entities = adjacent in the same swim lane.
- **ERD / Data Model payload constraints:**
  - Shapes: rectangle with rounded corners, branded fill colors.
  - Connectors: crow's-foot notation for cardinality.
  - Colors: Salesforce blue (#1B96FF) primary objects · gray (#F4F6F9) junction objects · orange (#E8A201) external.
  - Typography: Salesforce Sans or system sans-serif, 12pt minimum.
- **System / Integration payload constraints:**
  - Salesforce org: official cloud icon shape.
  - External systems: gray rectangle.
  - Data flows: solid arrows (sync) · dashed arrows (async / event-driven).
- **Multi-page diagrams:** represent all pages in the single `create_document` payload.
  Check the schema for the pages/tabs array structure. Never call `create_document` once per page.
- **One call per diagram — no exceptions.** Build the full spec (all shapes, groups, swim lanes,
  connections, all pages) before calling. Never create shapes individually then connect in separate calls.
- Always verify the result of each MCP call explicitly — throttle errors may be silent.

## Generated Prompts Registry (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- The project keeps `.generated-prompts/` at the repo root — one file per artifact type
  (`apex.md`, `lwc.md`, `flows.md`, `triggers.md`, `diagrams.md`, `cicd.md`, etc.).
- **Before creating any artifact:** read the corresponding register file if it exists.
  Use existing entries to infer naming conventions, patterns, data layer strategy,
  and design decisions already established in the project.
- **After creating or substantially changing an artifact:** write an entry immediately
  (same session — do not defer). Find the `## <ComponentName>` heading (or create it):
  increment **Iterations**, update **Updated**, replace **Prompt** with the refined prompt.
- Never stack versions — only the latest prompt lives in the entry.
- **Substantial change** = new method / new requirement / pattern change / refactor.
  Typos, formatting, and single-line corrections do NOT update the entry.

  Entry format:
  ```markdown
  ## <ComponentName>
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Iterations:** N

  ### Key decisions
  - <pattern / constraint / design choice>

  ### Prompt
  ```
  <prompt summarized to key decisions if over 500 words>
  ```
  ---
  ```

## Documentation Standards
- Every `/docs/*.md` must start with the Salesforce Cloud logo header:
  `![Salesforce Cloud](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691f4b0505409df23e191b87/69416b267de7ae6888996981_logo.svg)`
- Author: **Salesforce Professional Services**. Version: increment on significant changes.
- Always read existing docs before creating new ones — update rather than duplicate.

## Semantic Commits
- Ask for **Backlog Item ID** before suggesting any commit.
- Format: `type(ID): short description`.
- Body: numbered list of changes + value proposition paragraph.

## Sub-agent Handover
- Pass to TA: scope analysis artifact, solution design artifact, open architectural questions.
- Pass to BA: completed user stories with acceptance criteria for validation.
- Pass to Developer: execution stories with technical notes populated.

## Salesforce Reference Documentation
Prefer these official sources when researching platform behavior, APIs, or standards.

### Local Cache (check first)
- Before fetching any doc URL, check `.setup-agents/references/` for a cached copy.
  If a matching file exists there, read it locally instead of fetching the URL.
- Run `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs` to pre-populate the cache.

### Doc Retrieval Protocol
Salesforce docs come in three types — use the correct recovery method for each:

**Type 1 — Atlas-style** (URL pattern: `/docs/atlas.en-us.{guide}.meta/...`)
- 17 KB SPA shell, 0 HTML content. `get_document` API returns 0 bytes without auth.
- **Recovery: PDF only.** Use the PDF at `resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/{name}.pdf`.

**Type 2 — New-style LWR** (URL pattern: `/docs/{product}/{guide}.html`)
- ~64 KB, partial SSR: `<h1>` + intro paragraphs + TOC. Full content loads via JS at runtime.
- **Recovery: WebFetch the URL for intro/TOC only.** For complete content use the corresponding PDF.

**Type 3 — Direct PDFs** (`resources.docs.salesforce.com/.../sfdc/pdf/*.pdf`)
- Full content, no JS. **Recovery: WebFetch the PDF URL directly.**

### Core Platform

## Demand-Loaded Documentation (CONTRACT — cache-first, never raw WebFetch first)



Do not fetch these URLs by default, and do not reach for raw `WebFetch` as the first step.

When the task matches an activation signal, retrieve docs in this order:

1. Search the local reference cache first: `.setup-agents/references/` (the doc-retrieval skill).

   These cached `.md`/`.html` files are often very large (some exceed 5MB). **Use `Grep` with a

   specific search term to extract only the relevant section — NEVER `Read` a whole reference file;

   a full read of a multi-MB doc will blow the context window.** Read only the matched line ranges.

   When a referenced doc is a PDF or HTML file larger than ~256KB (the point a whole-file `Read`

   fails / blows the context window), do NOT `Read` it whole. First convert it with

   `sf setup-agents extract pdf-to-markdown --input <file> --out <file>.md` (or `html-to-markdown`),

   then `Grep` the resulting `.md` for the relevant section and read only the matched line ranges.

2. If the doc is missing from the cache, populate it with `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs`

   and grep the cached copy.

3. Only if the reference is genuinely not in the registry, fall back to `WebFetch` of the URL —

   and record the gap (the URL should be added to the refs registry).

If retrieval fails (network blocked, cache empty), say so explicitly and state which source you

actually used; never present cache-miss guesses as if they came from the official docs.
